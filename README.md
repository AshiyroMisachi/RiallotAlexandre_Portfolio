# Me, Alexandre Riallot

I'm a student at **ESMA Rennes** school in Video game conception and I want to be a **Game Programmer**.

Since childood, I'm passionated by video game and curious by how they work and all the secret they keep in their conception. I discovered the programmation in college and directly loved it. So, in 2022 I wanted to matched these two passion and make my adventure in Video game Programmation at the ESMA school. 

In this school I learned a lot of skills in programmation in general like:

* Python
* C++
* Phaser
* Unity
* Unreal Engine
* Etc...

Today, I mostly use **Unity** and **Unreal** Engine to prototype and grind skills in game programmation with a current preference for Unity.

I have skills in **gameplay** and **UI/UX**, and always push my skills to learn new things to improve day by day. I'm also interested in AI programming and Tool programming. 

I'm very **curious**, i love discover about new things in programmtion but also in general. So i like to know what people do around me and love to ask question about various thing!
