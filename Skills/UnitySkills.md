 # My Skills on Unity

 I have started Unity in 2023, it was my first 3D engine and use it a lot during my scholarship.   
 I used Unity for differents kind of projects or prototypes so I am used to 2D and 3D games and worked on PC and Android games. 

I really like Unity for his simplicity when I am doing Gamejam or little project but love to explore and learn all his complex aspect !


## UI Programming

I familiar with the UI system of Unity. I can make responsive UI adapted for different screen size.  
I did a lot of menu and HUD and I know how add theses at the gameplay part.
