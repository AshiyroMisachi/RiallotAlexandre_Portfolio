 # My Skills on Unity

 I have started Unity in 2023, it was my first 3D engine and use it a lot during my scholarship.   
 I used Unity for differents kind of projects or prototypes so I am used to 2D and 3D games and worked on PC and Android games. 

I really like Unity for his simplicity when I am doing Gamejam or little project but love to explore and learn all his complex aspect !

## Scripting in general

I know how to use **heritage** and **delagate** on Unity to simplify addition to my project.   

I know how to use **data assets** to easely make variation of the same GameObject with scriting to not accumulate Prefab.
