# **My Skills on Unreal Engine 5**

I have started Unreal Engine as my second 3D engine during my scholarship, and used it for different kind of projects or prototype. I discovered a lot of features and workflow on the software and learned how to use them.   
I have learned using Unreal Engine using only **Blueprints** but I want to learn C++ in the near future to progress more in the software !   
Unreal Engine was a lot more difficult than Unity to understand but now with a all the practice I had, I like this software and love all the possibility it can offers !

## **Unreal Engine Workflow**

I had a lot of lessons about Unreal Engine and his specific workflow. So, I have a global understanding of the software and know the good practice to have when I use it.  
I know how to name and sort my files on the project architecture, and where I must put my code in function of when it must be called in game.

## **Blueprints**
With all the project and prototype I made, I had the time to experiment a lot with blueprint and understand them to make dynamic and flexible code using features like components, interfaces and parenting. 


***
## **UI Workflow and Programming**
With my graduate project Tinykinesis, I had the occasion to learn more about UI in Unreal with the Widget. I learn how to make responsive UI and how to cut the HUD in different Widget to easely make change on the UI.

I also learned how to make simple UI Material to make custom ProgressBar for exemple.

## **Tools**

I had the occasion to make some little tools with Editor Utility Widget to simplify action or setup for my coworker in Blueprint or system I made.

## **Others Workflow**

### **Level Creation**

I know how to use the differents tools to quickly make blocking with Brush setting, Modeling and Landscape. I know also how to use LevelStreaming to optimize a level. 

### Sequence

In correlation with the Level Creation, I learned how to make and use Level Sequence to make simple animation and use them in Blueprint. Same thing with Template Sequence where I use to animate Blueprint with multiple Static Mesh. 

### Sound with Fmod
With my graduate project Tinykinesis, I had the occasion to learn how to integrate sound on Unreal Engine using Fmod plugin.
